        "body": "<p>There is a question on workplace.SE about a company which offered to pay travel costs for a job interview, but canceled the return ticket after ending the interview - <a href=\"https://workplace.stackexchange.com/questions/126565/potential-employer-cancels-return-flight\">Potential Employer Cancels Return Flight</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Generally, when arranging a job interview which requires the candidate to travel, it is common for the potential employer to pay travel cost and lodging for the candidate. In practice, the employer will ususally offer this, often in writing, but not write up a formal contract or similar document.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In that situation, can the employer later renege on the promise to pay costs?</strong> In particular, can they renege after the candidate has begun their journey, thus saddling the candidate with the travel cost?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>My thoughts:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>On the one hand, a simple one-sided promise is usually not binding, as a binding agreement requires both sides to give something (called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration\" rel=\"noreferrer\">consideration</a> in Common law).</li>\n<li>On the other hand, there is the notion of <a href=\"https://www.mccaberabin.com/business-copyright-faq/what-is-detrimental-reliance/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">detrimental reliance</a>, which appears to fit here. Also, one could argue that the candidate <em>does</em> provide something in exchange, namely their presence and willingness to attend the interview (basically, the company trades travel costs for having the candidate  present for the interview).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, is the promise to pay the candidate's cost enforceable or not?</p>\n\n<p>Im interested in any jurisdiction, particularly European and US.</p>\n"

        "body": "<p>I am a high school Chemistry teacher. This morning, while my back was turned to write on the board, one of my students (age 17) slipped a pill into my coffee mug. This is a thermos-style mug that has a screw-on lid with a small opening; it was obviously a deliberate act). </p>\n\n<p>About 30 minutes later, when the bell rang to change classes, another student stayed behind to tell me NOT to drink anymore coffee \"because [student name] put a white pill in it\". Apparently, all 22 of my other students had witnessed this and even clapped and laughed as the perp ran back to her seat when I turned around. I had no idea what had happened and continued drinking my coffee as usual until the 2nd student warned me to stop. </p>\n\n<p>I quickly went to be checked out by the school nurse who checked my vitals and found an irregular, rapid heartbeat and high blood pressure (both unusual for me). I was sent to the urgent care / occupational med clinic and underwent 3 hours of testing (x-rays, ekg, drug screening, etc). Luckily, no residual problems. </p>\n\n<p>While I was gone, the student was searched and \"Herbal Viagra\" was found. She admitted to putting it into my coffee. She was suspended for 5 days. I told the school resource officer that I wanted to file charges against her and he said all she'll get is a \"citation\" because it isn't actually \"criminal\". Maybe it's because it wasn't a controlled substance. I can't believe that it's NOT A CRIME to drug someone without their knowledge or consent. Herbal supplements can interact with other meds wreaking havoc on a body. She doesn't know what meds I already take or what allergies I have. I was lucky... this could have turned out far worse than it did. </p>\n\n<p>What are the legal ramifications of this situation? Is it a criminal act? What about the other 21 students who saw what happened and did/said nothing; just watched me ingest the medicine? Are they not accessories?</p>\n\n<p>I live in Louisiana, by the way. Not sure if that matters. </p>\n"

        "body": "<p>My youngest is a freshman &amp; signed up for a program the school refers to as \"co-lab\". At my insistence.\n2yrs ago, I attended a board meeting where the formation of the program was introduced. At the time, I was jumping out of my skin, I was so excited.it incorporates 5-6 subjects into 1 5-6hr block.</p>\n\n<p>Without getting into the boring details, the bottom line is what they proposed vaguely resembles what is in play. \nAll the subjects are still being taught, but separately instead of seamlessly together. </p>\n\n<p>He has As &amp; Bs in all but 1 subject  - Digital Literacy. The sole reason being that the school expects him to create a public Twitter account, with his real information, in order to promote the program &amp; the results of the program. \nThe results being, if I understand correctly, their personality, family history/tree, how their life experiences have shaped them into who they are today. These details were NOT part of the initial proposal nor part of anything sent home to me, to my knowledge. </p>\n\n<p>On 2 separate occasions, during school functions I attended, his reluctance to do this step has come up. He has stated that he does NOT want to create an account on FB or  Twitter. He's not comfortable with that. No questions asked, I turned back to the teacher &amp; said  - you have your answer. I will not force him to do that. </p>\n\n<p>Yesterday, I received a call from the teacher regarding this, after reviewing his progress report which shows him failing that subject. She explained his failing grade was due to his resistance in creating the acct.\nHe tried to compromise with them &amp; created a fake acct using a nickname a teacher had given him in 8th grade. (HE informed me of that, not the teacher). During the call, not knowing he had attempted that already, I suggested that as a compromise. But they won't accept that. Their claim is that it needs to be seen by the public, he needs to create a digital footprint, yadda, yadda. </p>\n\n<p>When asked how this would affect his grades in the other, now separate, subjects, she could not give me an answer. \nThis class is ONLY available for a freshman. It will have nothing to do with his next 3yrs of education. Yet his information will forever be out there even if never utilized or deleted after.\nThere's a parallel story to this which has bugged me, but this is the crux of THIS situation. </p>\n\n<p>My question is, is this public school allowed to force him to create a digital footprint on an already worldwide controversial platform, POSSIBLY holding his entire freshman year over his head? At the very least, forcing him to retake the one class, which may end the same way?</p>\n\n<p>Given the current environment, I'm one pissed off Mama bear. And he's ready to cave to the bullies, something I drilled into both my boys to never do.</p>\n\n<p>Thoughts?</p>\n"

He just politely requested money without making any threats.</p>\n"
