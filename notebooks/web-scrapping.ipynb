      "      \"body\": \"<p>This is not a simple question. There are hundreds of page treatises on consent - explicit, implied, obtained by trickery, revoked, coerced by show, coerced by intimidation. If it ever was just a he said (s)he said situation, that certainly  does not mean that the testimony of those two individuals are all that's considered to determine (1) that the prosecutor failed to meet it's burden; nor does it mean (2) that the consent was (legally) given. None of these answers (nor this answer) could possibly adequately  address the complexity of the analysis a court will endeavor to undertake when evidence is the result of a search that was alleged to be consensual. The court will look to the totality of the circumstances to make this determination.</p>\\n\\n<p>What is correct is that this is a question of law for a judge, and not a question of fact for a jury.</p>\\n\\n<p>The clarifying comments (somewhat) allude to the depth of the inquiry. What is a complete misnomer is that there is one standard or burden, because they can shift based on the circumstances and the arguments made. It is always going to undertake a complete analysis of the entirety of the circumstances and never just the testimony of cop vs. suspect.</p>\\n\\n<p>The what, where, who and when of the search are also really important and will always impact the ruling. Was it a car? Rules as to vehicular searches are different depending on the circumstances. Who agreed to the search - a child?  A roommate? A spouse or domestic partner? Different rules apply to all these situations.  What was searched? Was it a house? A hotel room? Rules apply to threshold entry. If a dwelling and the defendant did not consent, how did they get in? Was the door broken? What was the scope of the search? Was it invasive or limited? Did it start with plain view evidence?  Was it a search of person? At an airport? At customs? Were they already under x-ray analysis? Was Miranda issued? These and many other things matter....a lot!</p>\\n\\n<p>It is almost never just the defendant saying that consent wasn't given (eg. police search because of consent then defendant denies consent)  There is always intrinsic or extrinsic evidence to consider. Actual physical or  circumstantial evidence. Witnesses to the search. Something. </p>\\n\\n<p>Typically, what you see are cases where the scope of consent is broadened by the police without additional consent, (eg. defendant said police could look around living room and they opened up drawers or went into the kitchen), or coercion is argued, or most commonly, it is argued that although consent was given, it was involuntary. There are a million ways to argue these factors but nobody will ever believe the police searched on consent when it just blatantly never happened. They don't. They would sooner make up probable cause for a warrant, or claim that there was exigent circumstances than search based on consent that never occurred. Consent happens all the time. It is the most used type of search leading to arrest, because people just don't think they can say no. Testimony of the defendant alone is rarely going to be enough to overturn a search. There is <em>always</em> something more. The analysis is based on the totality of the circumstances....the court(s) have said this time and time again.</p>\\n\\n<p>As the United States Supreme Court explained, \\u201cThe standard for measuring the scope of a suspect\\u2019s consent (or if a suspect consented) under the Fourth Amendment is that of objective reasonableness - what would the typical reasonable person have understood by the exchange between the officer and the suspect?\\u201d <em>Florida v.

Baciga) The argument goes something like this - a crime was committed in a bedroom, and during the course of the trial on the merits the jury found out that the reason the police knew about the crime was because a cop was peeping through the curtains. If the jury was so offended by the police activity they could acquit, thus nullifying the judges determination that a search was lawful. On the other hand, what usually happens is that the cop goes and gets a warrant, and all the jury hears about during the trial is the warrant because the judge decided before the trial on the merits that the chain of events leading to the warrant was lawful. (Incidentally, this is not a question of credibility but could easily be extended there.)</p>\\n\\n<p>There is no indication of whether this question regards  criminal or civil cases. Based on the order the facts are presented (cop goes first), I assumed criminal. But the facts could also apply to a civil case for deprivation of constitutional rights. In a <a href=\\\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">\\u00a7 1983 civil action</a> the jury decides the issue of consent, and it's the plaintiff who must prove that the search was not voluntary or, said differently, that an asserted exception to the warrant requirement did not apply. <a href=\\\"http://openjurist.org/16/f3d/1513\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Larez v.

The Workplace SE post\\nreflects a company's <em>breach of contract</em>. The subsequent comments here about <em>fraud\\nhypotheticals</em> are mostly derivative inquiries beyond what\\nis described in Workplace SE. In particular, we do <strong>not</strong> assume\\nwhatsoever that the stranded candidate committed fraud.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/36259/if-a-company-agrees-to-pay-travel-cost-for-a-job-interview-is-the-promise-bindi/36261?noredirect=1#comment65229_36261\\\">The_Sympathizer</a> commented:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>can the contract be voided <em>on the spot</em> like that without first\\nproving in court? As it seems like it grants a rather &quot;vigilante&quot;\\njustice power that is open to abuse, since effectively the\\n&quot;punishment&quot; (cancellation of the flight and thus inducing a rather\\nserious physical situation) is administered before any due process has\\nbeen afforded the one accused.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Yes, it can be voided <em>on the spot</em> (aka <em>sua sponte</em>).</p>\\n<p>&quot;Vigilante&quot; justice denotes a self-attribution of <em>punitive</em> powers that exclusively belong to the state/government/court, whereas a party's voiding of a contract is the act of <em>foreclosing</em> his losses/exposures with respect to a contract that <em>de facto</em> never existed (such as when that contract was induced by fraud).</p>\\n<p>I agree that unfortunately that is open to abuse: As a pretext to actually incur <em>breach of contract</em>, a company might allege that the contract was void. That is why (if taken to court) it will be the company's burden to prove that (1) it reasonably relied upon a candidate's representations (2) which were significant and blatantly false (3) given the candidate's knowledge that his lies contravened the job's core requirements.</p>\\n<p>That can be quite burdensome. For instance, is the company handing out airfares without first conducting some <em>competent</em> corroborations about the candidate's credentials/skills? If so, one can hardly concede the company's allegation of <em>reasonable reliance</em>. The resulting finding would be that the contract was not voidable by the company, and thus that it is liable for <em>breach of contract</em>.</p>\\n<p>Also, belatedly &quot;informing&quot; the stranded candidate that the company &quot;<em>is going in a different direction</em>&quot; falls short of evidencing that the contract was voidable. That applies even if the candidate <a href=\\\"https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/36259/if-a-company-agrees-to-pay-travel-cost-for-a-job-interview-is-the-promise-bindi/36261?noredirect=1#comment65255_36261\\\">performed very poorly in the interview</a> or screening process.</p>\\n<p>Given the hardship imposed on a stranded candidate, a company has to be morally and legally very judicious about its method and timing for &quot;<em>going in a different direction</em>&quot;.</p>\\n<p>But absent any representations or [company's] bylaws to the contrary, a company generally does not have the obligation to afford <em>due process</em> to a candidate. The court <em>is</em> the entity with an obligation to enforce <em>due process</em> as provided by law (although many of us in the U.S. have repeatedly experienced the courts' disavowal of <em>due process</em>).</p>\\n<p><strong>--End of edit on 1/19/2019--</strong></p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>a binding agreement requires both sides to give something</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Here, the candidate's consideration is his time and effort to accommodate the company's interest in assessing the candidate's profile at a location that is convenient to the company.</p>\\n\"\n",

They can try to charge him for the ticket, or for half the ticket, or whatever - but they have a duty of care to get them home first. </p>\\n\\n<p>In English law, the rules for liability are: </p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li>Harm must be a \\\"reasonably foreseeable\\\" result of the defendant's conduct;</li>\\n<li>A relationship of \\\"proximity\\\" must exist between the defendant and the claimant;</li>\\n<li>It must be \\\"fair, just and reasonable\\\" to impose liability</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>I would say that all three apply in this situation, where the harm of being stranded at an airport without a ticket is \\\"reasonably foreseeable\\\", there was a relationship because the person was invited to an interview, and it is \\\"fair, just and reasonable\\\" to impose liability because the company caused the interviewee major cost and inconvenience to gain a small amount of money, that they could have easily got directly from the interviewee. </p>\\n\\n<p>Interestingly this doesn't answer the direct question (is the promise to pay the travel cost binding and enforceable), but here the actual damage caused was substantially higher than the normal cost of travel.
